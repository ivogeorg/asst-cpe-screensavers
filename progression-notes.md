These notes refer to the contents and step indices in [learning progression with la schema](learning-progression-with-la-schema.md).

**Step** | **Target program components** | **Apply tasks**
-- | -- | --
10 | 5 screensavers | Minimal piece of code with shown behavior
7 | Main program | Minimal versions of familar programs with structure
8 | Main program | Full functionality of work and sleep modes with minimal contents
1 | Main + screensavers | More elaborate versions of ss
2 | Function-based ss (e.g. bouncing ball)| Implement as functions (no need for classes)
3 | Class-based ss (e.g. rain) | Implement as classes
9 | Func and class-based ss | Iterative improvement
4 | Main + screensavers | Mapping of ss + array-based ss behaviors
5 | `LedSprite`, `game` | Compare and borrow into target components
6 | Extensions of past programs (incl. main & ss) | Experiments to show dynamics
11 | Coding simulation + 5 ss | Smoothing the display  
12 | Coding simulation + 5 ss | Randomization of behaviors
